# Current release notes

This page summarises the current user-visible beta release. Internal work items,
source paths, and implementation notes are deliberately excluded. For the full
version-by-version history and downloadable artefacts, use the
[GitHub release archive](https://github.com/eddacraft/anvil/releases).

## 0.9.0-beta — 12 July 2026

### Added

- `anvil welcome` provides an account-free first result on a user's own project.
- `anvil start` gives a quieter repeat-activation result and explicit protection
  state.
- `anvil insights --share` creates a reviewable local scorecard.
- Python joins the primary analysed language set.
- Read-only graph context is available to supported AI clients after explicit
  configuration.
- Infrastructure checks cover selected workflow, shell, container, and migration
  files.

### Changed

- Authentication-required action commands use a distinct exit code for safer
  automation.
- Interactive activation choices begin unselected; continuing without a choice
  writes nothing.
- Save-time activation manages the local daemon on supported platforms while
  read-only and non-interactive commands remain non-mutating.
- Graph persistence is enabled by default for faster warm starts and stores
  structural identity rather than source text.

### Fixed and hardened

- Secret scanning reduces low-value findings in common environment and lock
  files.
- Dashboard navigation and authentication output are more consistent.
- Workspace allowlists enforce only explicitly allowed roots.
- Credential, client configuration, and daemon state handling received
  additional platform hardening.

## Earlier beta releases

Earlier releases introduced the native Rust binary, local checks and gates,
architecture boundaries, save-time watching, Git hooks, machine-readable output,
and the public installer.
