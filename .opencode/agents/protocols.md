# Shared agent protocols

Shared protocols used by neutral eddacraft agents. This file is support
material, not an invokable agent.

## Reporting protocol

Your final message is your return value. The caller receives only that
message — not your transcript, not your intermediate output. End every run
with the complete report or structured output your contract names, never
with a progress note, a plan for the next step, or a wrap-up remark.

This is a measured failure mode, not a hypothetical: on 2026-08-14/15,
three independent verifier runs completed their work, then stopped on a
narration line ("Corpus measured. Now the gates…"), returning it as the
entire result. Each had to be resumed and asked for the report it had
already earned.

- Before ending, check the message you are writing: if it is not the full
  report, the run is not finished — write the report now, from evidence
  already gathered.
- Once the final report has begun, start no new tool action.
- If you bracketed temporary edits (scratch registries, amplification
  probes, reverted files), restore them and prove the workspace clean
  **before** starting the report, so an interrupted run cannot strand a
  mutated worktree.
- If work is genuinely unfinished, the report still goes out — with each
  incomplete item marked "not verified", never silently dropped.
- When your brief names a report reference, use the binding-provided durable
  record operation as each unit completes. The immutable per-attempt report is
  the crash-safe copy: a caller recovers a died or stalled run by reading it.

## Trigger protocol

When your work reveals an issue another installed specialist should address,
emit:

```text
TRIGGER:<target-agent>:<context>
```

For urgent issues, prefix the context with `!`. Common installed targets are
`security-analyst`, `adversarial-reviewer`, `debugger`, `tdd-coach`,
`operations-reviewer`, and `council-reviewer`.

## Negotiation protocol

When participating in a negotiation:

1. Read the topic and any previous positions.
2. State your position clearly with domain-specific reasoning.
3. End with exactly one of:
   - `CONSENSUS: [agreed approach]`
   - `COUNTER: [your position]`
   - `QUESTION: [clarification needed]`

Use no more than three rounds before escalating to the user.

## Governing contract (Council)

When a specification, ReadyItem, APS item, or named acceptance/non-goals is
supplied, that text is the contract. The diff is evidence of the change, not
a completeness target for the surrounding subsystem.

Classify each finding as `in_contract`, `later_item`, `out_of_scope`, or
`no_contract` (only if no spec was supplied). `critical` and `major` require
`in_contract` when a spec is present. Do not promote later-item or
out-of-scope work into this item's blockers.

## Severity levels

| Level    | Meaning                                                           | Commit gate?  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| CRITICAL | Data loss, security breach, crash, or broken build                | Blocks commit |
| MAJOR    | Significant issue that should be fixed or negotiated before merge | Should block  |
| MINOR    | Real issue but low impact or unlikely to trigger                  | Advisory      |
| NIT      | Style or preference, not a bug                                    | Optional      |
